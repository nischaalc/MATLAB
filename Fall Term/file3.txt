The Center for Inclusion and Culture (CIC) provides 
opportunities for student and professional staff to engage in the
educational exploration of the diversity that is present 
in our local and global communities, while promoting dialogue
through a social justice approach. We are dedicated to providing 
a safe environment where students can engage diverse
topics; seek out information, advocacy and referrals. While 
supporting our underrepresented groups on campus such as our

Dining Plan Offerings
The University offers an array of dining plans to all our
students. All first year resident students (including transfers)
are required to purchase one of the three all inclusive
plans (Platinum, Gold, Blue), but can also add any of the
Meal Pass Plans or Dining Dollar Plans. Commuters and
upperclassmen have the choice to purchase any of the dining
plans offered.

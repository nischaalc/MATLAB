%% Accelerometer Module, Week 2 Lab Investigation, Free Fall Detector

%% Overview
% This skeleton script connects MATLAB to the accelerometer and sets up a
% figure window for plotting data. The magnitude of all three of the 
% accelerometer's axes is shown. When received, new values are placed on
% the right end of the plot and old values are shifted off of the left end.
%
% You should be able to modify this code to use the magnitude data and
% setup a free fall detector. When the device is in free fall, you should
% alert the user by display a message or producing a sound.
%% Ensure that the ENGR 101 Accelerometer Files are Available
% This is a small administrative command. This ensures that the required
% commands to interface with the accelerometer/balance board are all
% available.

%% Initializing the Accelerometer and the Figure window
% Same as the previous script. See that file for more information.
if ~exist('accelerometer','var')
    accelerometer = setup_accel();
end

if exist('h','var') && ishandle(h)
    close(h)               
end

h = figure(1);


%% Data Collection and Display
% The rolling plot runs by creating an array of 300 values (initially as
% zeros). We plot that array, then we update it by appending it with the 
% a new reading from the accelerometer. To maintain the size of 300 values,
% the first value in the array is removed.


% ----- These variables are all used to initialize the rolling plot -----
buf_len = 300;
magdata = zeros(buf_len,1);
index = 1:buf_len;
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------

% Save the threshold in memory which will be used to detect the free fall.

    [gx gy gz] = accelerometer.read;

    % Calculate the magnitude of the accelerometer axis readings

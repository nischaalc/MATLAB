---------------Core Functionality----------------
-------------------------------------------------
This game relies on the two main equations for projectile motion in order to 
effectively carry out a simulation of a cannon ball travelling through the air. 
The aim of the game is to enter appropriate values for velocity and angle to ensure
that the cannon ball collides with a target. This target is randomly placed within 
the figure window each time the function is run, allowing for more unique gameplay
and also ensuring that the player is not able to beat the game once and keep doing it 
over and over again. 


-------------------------------------------------
-----------Advanced Functionality----------------
-------------------------------------------------
In order to make the game more user friendly, input is obtained through input boxes
that appear over the figure window, allowing the user to see the location of the 
target so that they can make a better guess as to the values to input. 
This game also displays images when a game is lost or when, displaying an image 
relevant to each scenario. 

-------------------------------------------------
---------------Specific Instructions-------------
-------------------------------------------------
None. The game is very straightforward and simple to understand.
